    "To begin creating a plugin (node) in python. We first need to understand what a node is. Kage defines nodes as an abstraction of a task or a job. Given an input (json) it returns and output (json) and artifacts (side effects, files, and other object). A node can be defined in Kage using a node schema file which is a json with the following properties.\n",

    "- `language`: Correct name of the language (e.g `python` not `py`).\n",

    "- `output_schema`: An object that shows what does the output of this plugin would look like. This is being used in graphs (another term for automation modules in Kage) to understand what is being sent to the next step of the process by this task.\n",
    "- `artifacts`: Least of possible side effects and artifacts files.\n",
    "- `source`: The path to the source of the plugin, or where the executables live.\n",
    "- `working_directory`: Can be empty or in the input schema but if mentioned here tells Kage to execute this task in a specific folder.\n",
    "- `entry_file`: The file that Kage would recognize as something that can be run for the desired output, defining this would enable you to have multiple files, folders and packages in the source directory, which makes writing more complex plugins easier."
