###### Short Description About Kage Ecosystem
Kage (acronyms of **K**ernel of **A**utonomous **G**raph-based **E**xecution, Read ) is a software project dedicated to make automations and pipeline creation easier, accessible and local.
Kage is a lightweight, modular automation system that enables users to create custom workflows and automations on their local machines.

## About
Kage Python Framework (KFP) is a library for secure io of [Kage]("https://github.com/thisismeamir/kage) with python source codes. It allows you to essentially use any python code as a new automation task, which can be used in automation workflows (called graphs in Kage technical terms). This library handles the task of input and output validation, entry-point recognition, making a python project executable and useful within the ecosystem of Kage.

Kage Python Framework is the first of the family of frameworks for Kage Plugin Development. I have in mind to provide similar frameworks for Kotlin, Java, C++, Go, and TypeScript.
